Here we're talking about our farm. Boy are we talking about it a
lot. We'll probably keep talking about it for a good while. This 
seems like a great spot to just ramble on about basically nothing.
If I saw this on a webpage I'd be mildly annoyed that the webstite
said there'd be an "About Us" section and all I got was this.
It'd be super obvious that the designer was just trying to fill 
space to allow this section to scroll.
